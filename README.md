# The Nick Shabazz Modular Knife, Sword, and Penholder (dmccaffrey fork)

This is a modular 3D model of a device which can be used to hold knives, pens, swords, or otherwise, generated in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/). Please see the .scad file for comments containing usability details.

## Fork notes
I made this fork partially to play around with the code, but also to reorganize it and change the parameterization to a format that made more sense to me logically. The functionality and rendering flow is largely the same but with the following changes:
- Support for specifying held obejcts and their parameters as lists to facilitate simple mixing of knives, pens, etc.
- Support for generating holders with separate bases to allow large objects to be held easier.

### Possible future changes
In the future I plan to extend this concept to other types of items I currently display:
- Calculators
- Keyboards
- Watches

## How to use
1. Download OpenSCAD for your platform: https://openscad.org/
2. See the inline documenation in shabazz_modular_knifeholder.scad to configure your desired display stand.
3. Render with your configuration.
4. Once you are happy with the displayed model, export to STL or other supported format and import into your slice of choice.
